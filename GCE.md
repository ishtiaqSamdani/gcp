**Compute Engine Machine Families:**

1. **General Purpose (E2, N2, N2D, N1):**
   - *Best price-performance ratio*
   - *Workloads:* Web and application servers, small-medium databases, dev environments.

2. **Memory Optimized (M2, M1):**
   - *Ultra high memory workloads*
   - *Workloads:* Large in-memory databases, in-memory analytics.

3. **Compute Optimized (C2):**
   - *Compute-intensive workloads*
   - *Workloads:* Gaming applications.

**Compute Engine Machine Types:**
   - *Variety of machine types for each family*
   - *Example:* e2-standard-2
     - *e2 - Machine Type Family*
     - *standard - Type of workload*
     - *2 - Number of CPUs*
     - *Memory, disk, and networking capabilities increase with vCPUs*

**Images:**
1. **Public Images:**
   - *Provided and maintained by Google, open source communities, or third-party vendors*
   - *Examples:* Pre-configured operating systems and software stacks.

2. **Custom Images:**
   - *Created by users for specific projects*
   - *Allows customization of the operating system and software stack*

**Configuring Instances:**
   - *Consider CPU, memory, and disk requirements*
   - *Choose the appropriate machine family and type based on workload characteristics*
   - *Example: e2-standard-2 for a general-purpose workload*

**External (Public) and Internal (Private) IP Addresses:**

1. **External IP Addresses:**
   - *Internet addressable.*
   - *Unique constraint: No two resources can have the same public (external) IP address.*
   - *Lost on stopping a VM instance.*

2. **Internal IP Addresses:**
   - *Internal to a corporate network.*
   - *Different corporate networks can have resources with the same internal (private) IP address.*
   - *All VM instances are assigned at least one internal IP address.*

**Creation and Management of IP Addresses:**
   - *VM instances are assigned at least one internal IP address.*
   - *External (public) IP addresses can be enabled for VM instances.*

**Demo: VM Instances - Internal and External IPs:**
   - *Showcasing the allocation and usage of internal and external IP addresses for VM instances.*

**Constant External IP Address for VM Instance:**
   - *Assigning a static IP address to the VM is a quick and dirty way.*
   - *Demo: Using static IP address with a VM instance.*

**Static IP Addresses:**
   - *Can be switched to another VM instance within the same project.*
   - *Remains attached even if the instance is stopped (manual detachment required).*
   - *Billed when not in use; explicit release recommended when not needed.*
