1. **Workspace Basics:**
   - Workspaces are a way to create multiple instances of the same infrastructure defined in a single Terraform configuration.
   - By default, Terraform starts with a single workspace named "default."

2. **Commands:**
   - `terraform workspace list`: Lists all available workspaces.
   - `terraform workspace new <workspace_name>`: Creates a new workspace.
   - `terraform workspace select <workspace_name>`: Switches to a different workspace.
   - `terraform workspace show`: Displays the current workspace.

3. **Usage:**
   - Workspaces are useful for managing different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) using the same Terraform code.
   - Each workspace has its own state file, allowing you to maintain separate state for each environment.

4. **Workspace-Specific Variables:**
   - You can define variables that are specific to a particular workspace by using the `terraform.workspace` variable.

   ```hcl
   variable "example_variable" {
     type    = string
     default = terraform.workspace == "default" ? "default_value" : "other_value"
   }
   ```

5. **Remote Backends:**
   - When using remote backends, it's important to ensure that each workspace has its own storage bucket or container. This prevents different workspaces from interfering with each other's state.

   ```hcl
   terraform {
     backend "s3" {
       bucket         = "my-terraform-bucket"
       key            = "${terraform.workspace}/terraform.tfstate"
       region         = "us-east-1"
       encrypt        = true
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Copying Workspaces:**
   - You can use the `terraform workspace new` command to create a new workspace based on an existing one. This is helpful for setting up similar environments quickly.

   ```sh
   terraform workspace new <new_workspace> -copy=default
   ```

7. **Deleting Workspaces:**
   - Be cautious when deleting workspaces, as it will remove all resources associated with that workspace. You can use the `terraform workspace delete <workspace_name>` command to delete a workspace.

   ```sh
   terraform workspace delete <workspace_name>
   ```

8. **Use Cases:**
   - Workspaces are commonly used for managing different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) within the same codebase.
   - They enable easier collaboration among team members working on different aspects of the infrastructure.
